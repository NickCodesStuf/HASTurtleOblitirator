# HASTurtleOblitirator

~ What does it do? ~
Code.org uses a program called turtle to draw. 
This code generates this turtle code given a set of points.
It can read a file for points then project the either orthographically or perspecticewise,
then it creates a preview via pygame and outputs the points to the console

~ How do I run this code? ~
You can either use the functions strait in main.py, or import it as a library to run
